#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) : Iterates through each instance in order to change value of a

b) O(n^2) : Utilizes nested for loop, creating an exponentially longer runtime

c) O(n) : Iterates through each instance of a bunny and denotes that two bunny ears exist for each bunny.

## Exercise II

-Iterate through each floor 
-If cuurent floor is < floor f, egg will not break
-If current floor is >= foor f, egg will break

Time complexity would be equal to O(n^2) due to the necessity of a nested for loop to check current floor
and then instantiate the next floor as current floor.
